     The midiget(n) and midiput(n) commands both use MIDI events in the same
     form.  A tclmidi(1) event consists of a list, where the first element is
     the time at which the event occurs and the second is the name of the
     event.  The list may contain other elements too, depending on the event
     type.  This is a list of all currently supported event types:

     {time NoteOff channel pitch [velocity]}
            The NoteOff event has three arguments: the first is the channel,
            the second the pitch, and the optional third is the velocity.  If
            a velocity is not specified, 0 is used.

     {time NoteOn channel pitch velocity}
            The NoteOn event has three arguments: the first is the channel,
            the second the pitch and the third the velocity.

     {time Note channel pitch velocity duration}
            The Note event is really a combination of the NoteOn and NoteOff
            events.  In fact, two events exist in the MIDI song with a link
            connecting them.  The Note event takes four arguments.  The first
            is the channel, and the second is the pitch.  The third is the ve-
            locity of the NoteOn, and the fourth is the duration until the
            corresponding NoteOff.  The implied NoteOff event assumes a veloc-
            ity of zero.

     {time KeyPressure channel pitch value}
            The KeyPressure event takes three arguments.  The first is the
            channel, the second the pitch and the third the pressure value.

     {time Parameter channel parameter value}
            The Parameter event has three arguments.  The first is the chan-
            nel, the second the parameter number and the third the associated
            value.

     {time Program channel value}
            The Program event has two arguments.  This first is the channel
            and the second the program value.

     {time ChannelPressure channel value}
            The ChannelPressure event has two arguments.  The first is the
            channel and the second the pressure associated with that channel.

     {time PitchWheel channel value}
            The PitchWheel event has two arguments.  The first is the channel
            number and the second the pitch wheel setting.

     {time SystemExclusive {byte byte ...}}
            The SystemExclusive event has one argument.  It is a list of data
            bytes to be sent as a system exclusive event.

     {time MetaSequenceNumber number}
            The MetaSequenceNumber event has one argument.  It is the sequence
            number.

     {time MetaText text}
            The MetaText event has one argument.  It is a text string.

     {time MetaCopyright copyright}

            The MetaCopyright event has one argument.  It is a text string.

     {time MetaSequenceName name}
            The MetaSequenceName event has one argument.  It is a text string.

     {time MetaInstrumentName name}
            The MetaInstrumentName event has one argument.  It is a text
            string.

     {time MetaLyric lyric}
            The MetaLyric event has one argument.  It is a text string.

     {time MetaMarker mark}
            The MetaMarker event has one argument.  It is a text string.

     {time MetaCue cue}
            The MetaCue event has one argument.  It is a text string.

     {time MetaChannelPrefix {byte byte ...}}
            tclmidi(1) does not know the proper form for a MetaChannelPrefix
            event, thus it has one argument.  This argument is a list of data
            bytes.

     {time MetaPortNumber port}
            This event determines which port to use on a multiport system.  It
            takes one argument, which is the port number.

     {time MetaEndOfTrack}
            The MetaEndOfTrack event has no arguments.

     {time MetaTempo bpm}
            The MetaTempo event has one argument.  It is the tempo specified
            in beats per minute.

     {time MetaSMPTE hour minute second frame fractional_frame}
            The MetaSMPTE event has five arguments.  They are the hour,
            minute, second, frame and fractional frame.

     {time MetaTime numerator denominator clocks 32nds}
            The MetaTime event has four arguments.  The first is the numerator
            of the time signature and the second is the denominator.  The
            third argument is clock ticks per beat, and the fourth is the num-
            ber of 32nd notes per quarter note.

     {time MetaKey key major|minor}
            The MetaKey event has two arguments.  The first is a text string
            describing the key and the second is either ``major'' or
            ``minor.'' The key strings may be the key name, A - G, followed by
            an optional ``flat'' or ``sharp.''

     {time MetaSequencerSpecific {byte byte ...}}
            The MetaSequencerSpecific event has one argument.  It is a list of
            data bytes.

     {time MetaUnknown code {byte byte ...}}
            The MetaUnknown event is for events not directly supported by
            tclmidi(1).  It has two arguments.  The first is the one byte code
            of the meta event, and the second is a list of the data bytes.
