     mmiiddiiccooppyy is a tclmidi(1) command that copies a range of events.  These
     events can be copied from one track to another, or copied within the same
     track.  The source range may overlap with the destination.

     The first argument is a list specifying a particular track in a MIDI
     song.  The first element of this list is a MIDI song identifier as re-
     turned by midimake(n),  or midinew(n).  The second element is a valid
     track number in the MIDI song.  This list specifies the destination track
     for the copy.

     The third argument is the time to start depositing the events specified
     in the source range.  Note, the first event might not be placed at exact-
     ly the requested time if an event does not occur at the start time for
     the source range.  The offset between the first event and the destination
     start time will be the same as the offset between the first event found
     in the source range and the start time of the source range.

     The fourth argument is another list identical in form to the list identi-
     fying the destination track.  This list specified the source track.

     The fifth and last arguments specify the range of events to be copied.
     They determine the start and end times of the range.  All events found at
     time _s_r_c_S_t_a_r_t_T_i_m_e up to, but not including events found at time
     _s_r_c_E_n_d_T_i_m_e will be copied.
