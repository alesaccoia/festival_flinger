     mmiiddiirreeccoorrdd is a tclmidi(1) command that records events from a MIDI device
     and puts them in a MIDI song.

     The first argument to mmiiddiirreeccoorrdd is a MIDI device identifier as returned
     from a call to mididevice(n).  The second argument is the MIDI song de-
     scriptor of the record song.  It should be one returned from midimake(n)
     or midiread(n).  The third argument is an optional MIDI song descriptor
     for a song that should be played while recording.  Furthermore, an op-
     tional fourth argument of ``repeat'' may be specified so the play song
     will be repeated.

     Recording continues until the midistop(n) command is issued.  midiwait(n)
     may be used to block until the play song finishes.

     All recorded events are put into track 0 of the MIDI song.

     mmiiddiirreeccoorrdd returns immediately with 0 if no MIDI devices are available,
     or 1 if one is.

BBUUGGSS
     The MPU-401 device interface dynamically creates events in the record
     MIDI song asynchronously.  Since this involves a call to malloc(3) which
     is not re-entrant, this is a potential hazard.  Until I figure out a way
     around this, avoid other calls to malloc(3) while recording.  The current
     TCL signal synchronizing commands found are not adequate for this task.
