     mmiiddiippllaayy is a tclmidi(1) command that plays a MIDI song through the MIDI
     device.

     The first argument to mmiiddiippllaayy is a MIDI device identifier, as returned
     by the midideivce(n) command.  The second argument is a song descriptor
     as returned by midimake(n) or midiread(n).  There may also be an optional
     third argument, ``repeat''. If ``repeat'' is specified, the song will re-
     play once the end is reached.

     mmiiddiippllaayy returns immediately with the value 1 if the song could be played
     or 0 if there is no MIDI device available.  midistop(n) must be used to
     stop playing of the song and midiwait(n) can be used to block until the
     song reaches the end.
