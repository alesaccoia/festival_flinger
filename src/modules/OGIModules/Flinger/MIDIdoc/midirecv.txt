     mmiiddiirreeccvv is a tclmidi(1) command that reads events from a raw device.
     All events currently available are returned with a time stamp of 0.  If
     no events are available, mmiiddiirreeccvv will block until one arrives.

     The first argument is a device ID, as returned by a call to
     mididevice(n).  It should be a raw MIDI device (one with a name like
     _/_d_e_v_/_r_m_i_d_i_0_)_.

     mmiiddiirreeccvv can be used simultaneously with midiplay(n).  Using it in con-
     junction with midirecord(n) on the same device will cause problems as
     they will both try to read from the same stream.

     See midievents(n),  for a description of MIDI events.
