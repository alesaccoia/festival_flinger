     mmiiddiiddeevviiccee is a tclmidi(1) command that creates a MIDI device and allows
     you to modify the configuration of an existing device if ttccllmmiiddii was
     built with device support.  A device driver for some MIDI interfaces is
     included with this release for the following architectures:
           BSD/OS
           Linux
           FreeBSD
           SVR4
     The first form of mmiiddiiddeevviiccee is used when the device is created for the
     first time.  The second form is used once the device has been created.

     The first parameter is the device identifier.  In the first case, it
     should be a path name for the device.  Something like, _/_d_e_v_/_m_i_d_i_0. In the
     second form it is a device identifier returned from a call to the first
     form.  In the third form, mmiiddiiddeevviiccee returns a ``1'' or ``0''. A ``1'' is
     returned if ttccllmmiiddii was built with MIDI device support and a ``0'' is re-
     turned if it does not have device support.

     The remaining arguments are parameters or commands that can be used to
     query or modify the device configuration.

     close        This command can only be used once a device has been created
                  by the first form of this command.  It closes the device.
                  Once the device has been closed, it cannot be used again un-
                  til it is reopened by a call to the first form of the mmii--
                  ddiiddeevviiccee command.

     midithru     Without a value, this command returns the status of
                  midithru.  It will return ``on'' if midithru is enabled, and
                  ``off'' if it is disabled.  If a value is specified is
                  should be a boolean value from one of, ``on'', ``yes'',
                  ``1'', ``off'', ``no'' or ``0''. The device will be conig-
                  ured to the specified value.

     slave        This command allows the device to be made a slave to anoth-
                  er.  When a device is a slave, it will be synchronized to
                  the master.  It will not begin playing until the master de-
                  vice does and will stay in time with the master.  Each de-
                  vice can only have one master, but a master device can have
                  any number of slaves.  The MasterDevID is the device ID of
                  the master device as returned from a call to the first form
                  of . The slave feature is useful if you want to play a MIDI
                  song that has more than 16 channels, and you have multiple
                  hardware MIDI interfaces.

     channel_on   Without an argument, this command returns the current list
                  of all channels that are active.  With an argument, it will
                  add a list of channels to the current active list.  The ac-
                  tive list is a list off all channels that will receive
                  events.  If a channel is inactive, any events on it will be

                  masked.  By default, all channels are active.

     channel_off  This is similar to the channel_on option, but returns a list
                  off all channels that are inactive.  If an argument is spec-
                  ified, it will remove a list of channels from the current
                  active list.

     In the first form, mmiiddiiddeevviiccee returns a device ID that can be used in
     later calls to mmiiddiiddeevviiccee or calls to other functions that deal with the
     MIDI interface.  In the second form it returns values according to the
     options specified.  See the list above for details.  In the third case,
     mmiiddiiddeevviiccee returns a ``1'' or ``0'' depending if ttccllmmiiddii was built with
     device support or not.
