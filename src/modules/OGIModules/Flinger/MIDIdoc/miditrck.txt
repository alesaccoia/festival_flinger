     mmiiddiittrraacckk is a tclmidi(1) command that gets information about a MIDI
     track.  Currently two types of information can be obtained.  These are
     the time of the first event found in the track, and the time of the last
     event in the track.  The time of the last event in the track might be
     different than that returned by a call to midiget getting the last event
     in a track.  This is because midiget returns NoteOn/NoteOff event pairs
     as a single Note event, and the Note event contains the time of the No-
     teOn event.  mmiiddiittrraacckk will return the time of the last event in a file
     including NoteOff halves of Note events.

     The first argument to mmiiddiittrraacckk is a MIDI song identifier.  The second
     argument is a track number of that song, and the last argument is one of
     either ``start'' or ``end''.

     mmiiddiittrraacckk returns the time of the first or last event in a track for the
     _s_t_a_r_t and _e_n_d options.

     mmiiddiittrraacckk might be expanded in the future to supply other types of infor-
     mation about MIDI tracks.
