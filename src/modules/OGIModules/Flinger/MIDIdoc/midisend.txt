     mmiiddiisseenndd is a tclmidi(1) command that write an event or events to a raw
     device.  The list of events will be sent out on the MIDI stream with a
     little delay as possible.

     The first argument is a device ID, as returned by a call to
     mididevice(n).  It should be a raw MIDI device (one with a name like
     _/_d_e_v_/_r_m_i_d_i_0_)_. The second argument is an events followed by zero of more
     optional events.  Each event should have a time stamp, but the stamp will
     be ignored.

     mmiiddiisseenndd can be used simultaneously with midiplay(n) and midirecord(n).
     Untimed events can be sent to a raw device while timed events are being
     played to the timed interface of the device.

     See midievents(n),  for a description of MIDI events.
