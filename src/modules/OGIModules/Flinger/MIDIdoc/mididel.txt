     mmiiddiiddeelleettee is a tclmidi(1) command that deletes one or more events from a
     specified track in a MIDI song.  The first argument is a MIDI song de-
     scriptor as returned by midimake(n) or midiread(n).  The second argument
     is the track in the MIDI song.  In the first form, the third argument is
     a specific event to remove.  For formatting of events, see midievents(n).


     In the second form, the third argument is the string ``range''. The
     fourth argument is then the start time of events to be delete and the
     last argument is the end time of the range.  All events starting at time
     _s_t_a_r_t up to but not including events at time _e_n_d are then deleted.

     mmiiddiiddeelleettee returns a 1 if the event or events were successfully removed,
     or 0 if, in the first case, the event could not be found.
