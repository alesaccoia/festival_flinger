     mmiiddiiccoonnffiigg is a tclmidi(1) command that gets or modifies the configura-
     tions values of a MIDI song.

     Without arguments mmiiddiiccoonnffiigg reports all three configuration values.  It
     can also take up to three optional arguments.  All arguments should be
     lists consisting of the parameter name followed by an optional value.  If
     a value for a parameter is not specified then the current setting is re-
     ported.  If a value is specified then the song parameter is changed.

     mfileId is a valid MIDI song identifier as returned by midimake(n) or
     midiread(n).

     The different parameters are:

     format    This option determines the song type.  There are three valid
               values: 0, 1 and 2.  A format 0 song has only one track which
               intermixes meta and normal events.  A format 1 song can have
               many tracks, but track 0 always contains most of the meta
               events, specifically MetaTempo events.  A format 2 song is sim-
               ilar to format 1, but each track can be played separately in-
               stead of playing them all in parallel.

     division  This specifies the resolution of the timing for the song.  If
               the unit of quanta for a song is is clock tick, there will be
               _v_a_l_u_e clock ticks per beat.

     tracks    This option specifies the number of tracks in the song.  These
               will by dynamically created and freed automatically.  The
               tracks are numbered 0 through _v_a_l_u_e - 1 including.  A format 0
               song should have only one track.

     If parameters are being set, mmiiddiiccoonnffiigg will return nothing.  If parame-
     ters are being queried, a list of lists will be returned.  Each sublist
     will contain the parameter name and its associated value.  The parameters
     are returned in the order specified or in the order _f_o_r_m_a_t_, _d_i_v_i_s_i_o_n_,
     _t_r_a_c_k_s if mmiiddiiccoonnffiigg is called without arguments.
