     mmiiddiiggrreepp is a tclmidi(1) command that will find all events in a specified
     track that match the pattern events in the command argumets.  This first
     argument is the descriptor for the MIDI song.  This descriptor should be
     one returned by midimake(n) or midiread(n).  The second argument speci-
     fies the track to index.  The third and remaining arguments are events
     that you wish to locate.  The syntax of these events is the same as that
     specified in midievent(n),  except that any field besides the event type
     field may be replaced by the * character.  The * character then acts as a
     wildcard and will match any value normally found for that parameter of
     the specified event type.  Any number of fields for an event can be wild-
     carded.

     For example, _m_i_d_i_g_r_e_p _s_o_n_g_0 _1 _{_* _N_o_t_e _1 _4_2 _* _*_} will find all _N_o_t_e events
     in _s_o_n_g_0 track _1 that are for channel 1, pitch 42, regardless of the note
     velocity, duration or the time the Note event occurs.

     mmiiddiiggrreepp returns a list off all the events that match the given event
     patterns.
