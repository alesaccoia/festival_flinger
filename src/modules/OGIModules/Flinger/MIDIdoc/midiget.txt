     mmiiddiiggeett is a tclmidi(1) command that gets one event from the specified
     track of a MIDI Song.  This first argument is the descriptor for the MIDI
     song.  This descriptor should be one returned by midimake(n) or
     midiread(n).  The second argument specifies the track to index.  The
     third argument is an index for that track.  This argument may be an abso-
     lute time index, the string ``next'' or the string ``prev.''

     Indices of ``next'' or ``prev'' will return one event that is immediately
     after or before the last event returned by mmiiddiiggeett. The string ``EOT''
     will be returned when the end (or beginning in the case of ``prev'') of
     the track is reached.  The command midirewind(n) will reset the track po-
     sition so that indices of ``next'' or ``prev'' will return the first and
     last events of the track, respectively.

     An absolute time index will return a list of all events at the specified
     time.  If there are no events at the specified time, then a list of
     events is returned with a time as close to, but greater than the time
     specified.  If there are no events with a time equal to or greater than
     the specified time, then the string ``EOT'' is returned.

     mmiiddiiggeett with an index of ``next'' or ``prev,'' returns one event, unless
     the end or beginning of the track is reached, in which case the string,
     ``EOT'' is returned.  mmiiddiiggeett with an absolute time index returns a list
     of all events that occur at that time.  If no events exist with a time
     equal to or greater than the specified time, the string ``EOT'' is re-
     turned.  All events are in standard event form, midievents(n).
